- `twin.macro` enables the power of tailwind to combine with CSS-in-JS. It has no runtime and converts the tailwind classes you write to preferred CSS-in-JS solution.
- `goober` is a 1kB solution for CSS-in-JS. Since we are writing tailwind classes, it's guaranteed that we won't be using most features of larger libraries like `styled-components` or `emotion`. This is where `goober` comes in, we get the transpiled CSS-in-JS with 1kB of Goober and some twin magic.
